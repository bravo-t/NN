# A framework for neural network
* Fully connected neural network and convolutional neural network written in C has finished.
  * [Readme for fully connected network](C/README.md#fully-connected-network)
  * [Readme for convolutional network](C/README.md#convolutional-neural-network)
* Two objectives:
  1. Enhance the C programs to make them multi-threaded, especially for the CNN.
  2. Implement the verilog version of the two networks.
