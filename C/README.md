## A neurual network framework written in C
* What is this
  * This is a neural network "engine" I wrote to figure out how a neural network works.
  * In "train" mode, this program takes in a configuration file, trians itself, and dumps out the learned weights.
  * In "test" mode, this program reads in the weights dumped out earlier, and calculate scores on the input date set.
* How to compile
  * Clone, or download all the source files.
  * Compile with `make`
* How to use
